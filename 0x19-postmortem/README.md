# Postmortem: Database Service Outage on June 20, 2024

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** 
  - Start: June 20, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC
  - End: June 20, 2024, 12:30 PM UTC
- **Impact:** 
  - The primary database service was down, causing a complete halt to all data retrieval operations. Users experienced service disruptions across the platform, with 100% of users unable to access their data.
- **Root Cause:** 
  - The outage was caused by an incorrect configuration change in the database's replication setup, leading to a cascade failure in the database cluster.

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM:** 
  - Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating high error rates on data retrieval operations.
- **10:05 AM:**
  - On-call engineer confirms the issue through additional monitoring tools and begins initial investigation.
- **10:10 AM:**
  - Engineers assume a network issue due to similar past incidents and start investigating network logs and connections.
- **10:30 AM:**
  - Network team reports no anomalies; focus shifts to the database cluster.
- **10:45 AM:**
  - Misleading path: Engineers suspect a DDoS attack and implement initial mitigations which do not resolve the issue.
- **11:00 AM:**
  - Database team is escalated; initial review shows replication lag and errors.
- **11:20 AM:**
  - Detailed investigation reveals a recent configuration change to the replication setup.
- **11:30 AM:**
  - Misleading path: Engineers revert to an older backup, but the issue persists as the configuration change affects the entire cluster.
- **11:50 AM:**
  - Root cause identified: Incorrect replication configuration was causing the primary database to fail.
- **12:00 PM:**
  - Corrective action taken: Correct replication settings are restored and the cluster is gradually brought back online.
- **12:30 PM:**
  - Full resolution: All services are fully operational, and data retrieval operations return to normal.

## Root Cause and Resolution

### Root Cause:
The primary issue was an incorrect configuration change in the database replication setup. This change caused the primary database node to fail, leading to a cascade failure across the cluster. The replication configuration was intended to optimize performance but instead introduced an unforeseen bug that disrupted communication between the nodes.

### Resolution:
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Identified the incorrect configuration in the replication settings.
2. Restored the correct replication configuration.
3. Gradually restarted the database cluster to ensure stability.
4. Monitored the system closely to confirm that data retrieval operations returned to normal.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements:
- Improved configuration change review process to prevent incorrect settings from being applied.
- Enhanced monitoring to detect replication issues more rapidly.
- Better documentation and training on database configuration management.

### Specific Tasks:
1. **Patch Database Configuration:**
   - Implement additional validation checks in the database management scripts to catch misconfigurations.
2. **Add Monitoring on Replication Lag:**
   - Introduce detailed monitoring and alerting for replication lag and errors.
3. **Review and Update Change Management Process:**
   - Establish a more rigorous review process for configuration changes, including peer reviews and automated testing.
4. **Training Sessions:**
   - Conduct training sessions for engineers on the new processes and best practices for database configuration.
5. **Update Documentation:**
   - Ensure all configuration changes and their implications are thoroughly documented and accessible to all relevant teams.
